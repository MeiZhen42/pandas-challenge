# Analysis Summary
Schools within a single district were analysed based on various criteria, including but not limited to: school type, students' math and reading scores, school budget, and size of the school.

Based on the results, grade level is not a limiting factor in test performance. The amount a student spends is not a limiting factor in test performance. The size of the school does impact how well a student performs in their studies. According to the data, students who attend schools within the 2000-5000 population range will perform significantly less than those in smaller schools. Lastly, the school type impacts how well a student will perform in math and reading tests, with those from a District school receiving lower scores compared to those from a Charter school.
